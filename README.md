 Hi there. ðŸ‘‹
 My name is Hristo.
I am a person who uses PHP to create web apps and mainly websites. My biggest project was called **BeeMo** - BeeMo is a system for monitoring bee colonies, designed to facilitate the work of the modern beekeeper.
I am always open for new and interesting project ideas.
